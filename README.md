# Touchless Sanitizer Dispenser (No MCU)

Lately, during an internship, I built a sanitizer dispenser using only **electronic components** (no programming / no microcontroller), including an 
**NE555 timer** and an industrial **proximity sensor (NPN)**.  
The NE555 controls the timing, allowing the dispenser to release sanitizer for about **1 second** each time it detects a hand.  

This repository contains the **schematic and PCB files** for the project in Kicad, ready for assembly.

## Files
just download all the files and put them in a foulder and open it with kicad , you find there
